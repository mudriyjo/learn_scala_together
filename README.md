# Learn Scala 3 together

Welcome to `learn_scala_together`. This project contains small practical exercises to get you to write Scala 3 code and understand basic and advanced features.

This project is inspired by tutorial projects from other languages, such as Rust and others.

The project's goal is to gradually study the Scala 3 language and expand the Scala user community using practical examples and practice using popular ecosystem libraries such as ZIO, Cats, Http4s, and others!

## Getting Started

You will need to have Scala and other tools installed. All instructions for this you can find in lesson 0: [link](https://github.com/mudriyjo/learn_scala_together/blob/main/00_tools_set_up)

## Project Structure

The project contains exercises with unique names to cover one specific topic. For example, exercise: 00_tools_set_up [link](https://github.com/mudriyjo/learn_scala_together/blob/main/00_tools_set_up) includes all that you need to prepare the environment and tools for start

All exercises were created to simplify the learning path and prepare you to quiz

## Excercise

Each exercise contains:

- Readme.md file where you can find learning features or functionality descriptions and links to other material and official documentation.
- Example of code that represents a specific feature
- Working example where you can train your knowledge and understanding
- Test to verify working examples

## Quize

Each quiz contains a pack of working examples to test your knowledge.
